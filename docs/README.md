### Web-Service
* The product created and documented in this repo is a very simple Flask app that displays data on air quality in New York City. Users can view a sample of New York City's air quality data from 2005 to 2021.
* The dataset used in this project was taken from Data.gov and contains information such as indicator/pollutant name, unit of measurement, geographical location it was measured at, and the date the data applies to. As the dataset contains 16218 rows, only a sample of 50 rows are displayed on the Flask app.
