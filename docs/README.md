## Web-Service
* The product created and documented in this repo is a very simple Flask app that displays data on air quality in New York City. Users can view a sample of New York City's air quality data from 2005 to 2021.
* The dataset used in this project was taken from Data.gov and contains information such as indicator/pollutant name, unit of measurement, geographical location it was measured at, and the date the data applies to. As the dataset contains 16218 rows, only a sample of 50 rows are displayed on the Flask app.

## Technologies Used
The tools and services used in this project include the following: 
1. Github - to version control the scripts 
2. Environment variables (.env) - to contain the credentials for Google OAuth and database connection strings for MySQL connection
3. Flask - the backend framework used in the web-service project to create a Flask app
4. Tailwind - the frontend framework for the web-service design
5. Azure Database for MySQL flexible server - database used in the project to include data into the Flask app
6. SQLAlchemy - the ORM used in the Flask app to create a connection with the MySQL database and query data.
7. Google OAuth - the authorization service used in the project to create a simple user authorization in the Flask app
8. Sentry.io - the logger service used in the project to log any issues in the web-service app
9. Docker - Docker was incorporated into the project to containerize the Flask app 
10. Cloud Deployment with Azure - the Flask app was deployed to the cloud using Microsoft Azure's App Services as another way of deploying the web application

## Steps to Running the Web-Service
The Flask web application can be deployed in 3 different ways: locally, using Docker, and cloud deployment with Azure. The following includes steps on how to run the application for each of the deployment ways. 
### Deploying Locally
1. To deploy the application locally, first clone the repo into your local environment in the terminal using: ```git clone https://github.com/c-susan/flask_e2e_project.git```
2. Once the repo is cloned onto your local environemnt, change your working directory to the `app` folder: ```cd flask_e2e_project/app```
3. In the terminal, run the application using ```python app.py```. The terminal will then create and show connection addresses which will bring you to the web application in another tab. 

### Deploying using Docker
The [app](https://github.com/c-susan/flask_e2e_project/tree/main/app) folder in the repo contains a Docker file which can be run to Dockerize the application. To Dockerize the application, make sure your working directory is in the [app](https://github.com/c-susan/flask_e2e_project/tree/main/app) folder with: ```cd flask_e2e_project/app```
1. Make sure to clone the repo into your local environment with ```git clone https://github.com/c-susan/flask_e2e_project.git``` and change your present working directory is in the app folder using: ```cd flask_e2e_project/app```
2. The first step to dockerizing the application is to create the Docker image. In the terminal, run: ```docker build -t <image-name> .```. Replace `<image-name>` with a name you want to call the Docker image.
3. Run ```docker images``` to cinfirm the image was successfully created. 
4. Once the image is create, you can run it with ```docker run -p 5000:5000 <image name>```. Replace `<image name>` in the code with the name you assigned to the docker image in the first step.

The following screenshot shows an example of how the application is Dockerized:

### Cloud Deployment with Azure 
1. The application can be deployed to the cloud using Azure's App Services. First, clone the repo into your local environment and make sure to your present working directory is in the app folder.
2. In the terminal, install the Azure CLI using the command: ```curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash```
3. Wait for the Azure CLI and to confirm it was successfully installed, run: ```az```. The following snapshot shows the successful installation of the Azure CLI:
<img width="350" alt="azure" src="https://github.com/c-susan/flask_e2e_project/assets/123512714/60e971bf-91f9-494f-a417-f0d3253ad18e">

 4. In the terminal, run ```az login --use-device-code``` and follow the directions from the output to login to your Microsoft account and authenticate your device.
 5. Run the command: ```az webapp up --resource-group <resource-group> --name <app-name> --runtime PYTHON:3.9 --sku B1``` to create a web application on Azure. In the command, replace `<resource-group>` with your own Azure resource group and replace `<app-name>` with the name you want to assign to your web application.
 6. A new web service will be created. The following image shows a snapshot of my Flask app being deployed on Azure.
<img width="700" alt="cloud deployment" src="https://github.com/c-susan/flask_e2e_project/assets/123512714/936be703-69a3-406f-b4c6-bb728ebea118">

7. In your azure account, search 'App Services' in the search bar and then locate the web app created in the menu. 

The following shows a screenshot of the App Services menu in Azure with my created web application. Web-service link: [504flaskproject.azurewebsites.net](504flaskproject.azurewebsites.net)

## Environment Variables (.env) File Structure
Environment variables were used in the project to contain the credentials for Google OAuth and database connection strings for MySQL connection. The following is the template of the .env file structure used in the repo:

Connection for the MySQL Connection: 
```
DB_HOST = <azure-host-link>
DB_DATABASE = <database-name>
DB_USERNAME = <username>
DB_PASSWORD = <password>
DB_PORT = 3306
DB_CHARSET = utf8mb4
```

Credentials for Google OAuth
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = <client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = <client-secret>
```
